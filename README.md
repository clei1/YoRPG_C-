We added a weapon feature to the game. If the hero of our game kills the monster, the monster drops a weapon and armor which he stole from a comrade who was not so lucky. Then, the user has the option of picking up the weapon, picking up the armor or leaving doing nothing. If the character picks up the armor, attack increases, but defense decreases. If the hero chooses the armor, attack decreases but defense increases.
